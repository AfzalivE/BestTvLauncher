# Best TV Launcher (WIP name)

An Android/Google TV launcher that shows you content from your existing apps.

The Google TV experience is all about helping you discover content but, in my experience, it doesn't show me only content that is already available on the services I subscribe to. This launcher aims to fix that by showing recommendations from the services you already use. This way, it'll make it easier to:

- Play the next episode of the shows you're watching
- Show you that movie that you were waiting to release
- Resume the media that you stopped watching mid-way
- Allow you to customize what you see on the home screen

# Development

This app is being developed in Jetpack Compose but Compose isn't ready for Android TV yet so inevitably there are going to be some bugs that we might find from time to time. Over the course of development, those bugs will disappear as the framework matures and it'll be interesting to follow that development.

TODO: Further notes on architecture and the Locator.

# Live Stream

I'll be live streaming the development of this app on [my Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/afzal____) and put recordings on YouTube (but I haven't yet done that part). Make sure to follow the Twitch channel so you don't miss it!
